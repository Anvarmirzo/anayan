				<p>Ruben Atoyan was born in Kirovakan, Armenia in 1954.</p>

					Passion for history and geography brought him to Moscow to start the scientific career. At the age of 17
					curious
					painter
					dived into the world of cartographic engineering to enrich it with his artistic view.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ruben was moving between countries, studying cartography and making art. He walked thousands of kilometres
					around
					European capitals and Caucasus mountains making sketches and outline maps.
					A wanderlust determined his path — in 1987 Ruben painted the first panoramic map of a tourist trail in a
					formed
					style.
					Till today the master already draw more that 100 precise artworks in this genre.

			<p class="manual__desc artistic__desc">The unique artist's perception of the world is reflected in his works, full
				of colours and
				life.
				<br>
				<br>
				One of the main expressive means Atoyan Ruben uses is line. Thin and sharp they form the silhouette of the
				district from
				the bird's eye view.
				<br>
				<br>
				Watercolour makes it volume and full of life. With the game of light and shade Ruben Atoyan highlights the main
				points
				of interest. The selected shades and colors take us beyond the flat image, conveying a direct experience of the
				atmosphere of the place.
				<br>
				<br>
				Ruben Atoyan’s maps usually include picturesque natural background: mountains, see or forest and a decoration in
				a
				style
				of antique maps of XVI-XVII centuries.

					will change, but the memory of the special moment
					of its existence is forever kept by the map.

					Of course for practical purposes sometimes it is necessary to update the map. The artist draws new
					buildings/districts
					and then these elements are added on the computer to the scanned original map.
